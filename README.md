<p># Divvy-trip-2019 & 2020: A Comparative Analysis of Rider Behavior</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> Data Analyst</p>
<p>## Project Overview</p>
[cite_start]<p>The aim of this project is to analyze and compare Divvy trip data from 2019 and 2020 to understand rider behavior[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]The analysis focuses on key aspects such as trip duration, station usage, and rider demographics[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]By examining these trends, we can gain insights into how the usage of the Divvy bike-sharing program changed between the two years[cite: 1, 2].</p>

<p>## Data and Methodology</p>
[cite_start]<p>The project uses Divvy trip data from 2019 and 2020[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]The methodology involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]We've utilized charts and graphs to represent key findings, such as the top 10 starting stations and the percentage of casual versus member riders[cite: 1, 2].</p>

<p>## Key Findings and Analysis</p>
<p>### <b>Station Popularity</b></p>
[cite_start]<p>The analysis of starting stations reveals the most popular locations for Divvy trips[cite: 1]. [cite_start]A bar chart shows the top 10 starting stations, with <b>Streeter Dr & Grand Ave</b> being one of the most frequently used[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This finding suggests that certain areas, likely with high foot traffic or tourist activity, are more popular starting points for riders[cite: 1].</p>
<p>### <b>Rider Type</b></p>
[cite_start]<p>A comparative analysis of rider types (casual vs. member) was conducted[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]A bar chart illustrates the percentage of each rider type in both 2019 and 2020[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]The data shows a significant percentage difference in the proportion of casual riders between the two years[cite: 1]. [cite_start]For both years, members make up the vast majority of riders[cite: 1, 2]. [cite_start]However, there was a greater proportion of casual riders in 2020 than in 2019[cite: 1]. [cite_start]This could indicate a change in rider demographics or usage patterns, potentially due to external factors[cite: 1].</p>
