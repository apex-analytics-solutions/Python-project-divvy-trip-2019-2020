  <h1>Divvy-trip-2019 & 2020: A Comparative Analysis of Rider Behavior</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Data Analyst</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The aim of this project is to analyze and compare Divvy trip data from 2019 and 2020 to understand rider behavior. The analysis focuses on key aspects such as trip duration, station usage, and rider demographics. By examining these trends, we can gain insights into how the usage of the Divvy bike-sharing program changed between the two years.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>Data and Methodology</h2>
  <p>The project uses Divvy trip data from 2019 and 2020. The methodology involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. We've utilized charts and graphs to represent key findings, such as the top 10 starting stations and the percentage of casual versus member riders.</p>

  <h2>Key Findings and Analysis</h2>
  
  <h3>Station Popularity</h3>
  <p>The analysis of starting stations reveals the most popular locations for Divvy trips. A bar chart shows the top 10 starting stations, with <code>Streeter Dr & Grand Ave</code> being one of the most frequently used. This finding suggests that certain areas, likely with high foot traffic or tourist activity, are more popular starting points for riders.</p>
  
  <h3>Rider Type</h3>
  <p>A comparative analysis of rider types (casual vs. member) was conducted. A bar chart illustrates the percentage of each rider type in both 2019 and 2020. The data shows a significant percentage difference in the proportion of casual riders between the two years. For both years, members make up the vast majority of riders. However, there was a greater proportion of casual riders in 2020 than in 2019. This could indicate a change in rider demographics or usage patterns, potentially due to external factors.</p>
